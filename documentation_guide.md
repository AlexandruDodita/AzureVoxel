# AzureVoxel Project Documentation

AzureVoxel is a voxel-based 3D environment/game engine featuring a sophisticated Block Registry system for modular block management and advanced multi-threaded chunk processing. The engine supports both flat terrain and spherical planet generation with advanced biome-aware block selection and context-sensitive material placement. The core architecture revolves around a data-driven approach where block definitions are managed through a centralized registry system that supports environmental adaptation and performance optimization.

The Block Registry system implements a component-based architecture with BlockDefinition, BlockVariant, and BlockRenderData structures, enabling context-aware block selection based on biome and planet conditions. This allows for dynamic material adaptation where the same logical block type can have different properties and appearances depending on environmental factors.

The engine now supports massive planetary worlds (10,000+ block diameter) through dynamic chunk-based loading that only generates terrain near the player, ensuring optimal performance for large-scale exploration. The sophisticated biome generation system uses multiple noise layers to create diverse terrain features including mountains, valleys, lakes, forests, deserts, swamps, volcanic regions, and arctic zones.

Performance is optimized through O(1) lookup tables, pre-computed context mappings, branch-free face culling operations, dynamic chunk loading, and a multi-threaded chunk processing pipeline that separates data generation, mesh building, and OpenGL initialization across multiple thread pools for maximum efficiency.

## Multi-Threaded Architecture

The engine implements a sophisticated multi-threaded chunk processing pipeline:

### Thread Pool Architecture
- **ChunkGenerationThreadPool**: Handles terrain data generation (CPU-intensive noise calculations, biome determination)
- **MeshBuildingThreadPool**: Processes mesh construction from block data (face culling, vertex generation)
- **MainThreadTaskQueue**: Manages OpenGL operations that must run on the main thread (VAO/VBO creation, texture binding)

### Chunk Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Generation Phase** (Worker Thread): Generate block types, biome data, save/load from disk
2. **Mesh Building Phase** (Worker Thread): Build vertex/index buffers, perform face culling
3. **OpenGL Initialization Phase** (Main Thread): Create VAO/VBO/EBO, bind textures
4. **Rendering Phase** (Main Thread): Draw calls using prepared mesh data

### Thread Safety
- Atomic state management using `std::atomic<ChunkState>` for chunk processing states
- Mutex protection for shared data structures (`dataMutex_`, `meshMutex_`)
- Lock-free task queues for inter-thread communication
- Separate data structures for different processing phases to minimize contention

## Game Architecture and Design

### Conceptual Overview

AzureVoxel is a voxel-based 3D environment/game engine built around a modular Block Registry architecture with advanced multi-threaded chunk processing. The core system revolves around a `World` which can contain multiple `Planet` objects. Each `Planet` is composed of `Chunk`s, which in turn are made up of individual `Block`s managed through the centralized `BlockRegistry`. Rendering is managed through OpenGL, with a `Window` class handling GLFW interactions, a `Camera` class for viewpoint control, and `Shader` and `Texture` classes for visual representation. A `Crosshair` class provides a 2D UI element.

The system is designed with performance in mind, particularly for rendering large voxel worlds and planets. Key aspects include:
*   **Block Registry System:** Centralized management of all block definitions, variants, and properties with O(1) lookup performance
*   **Context-Aware Block Selection:** Biome and planet-aware block placement using environmental contexts
*   **Multi-Threaded Chunk Processing:** Separate thread pools for data generation, mesh building, and OpenGL operations
*   **Planet-based world management:** The `World` manages planets. Planets manage their own chunks through the threaded pipeline.
*   **Spherical Chunk Generation & Meshing:** `Chunk`s can now generate terrain and meshes that conform to a spherical planet surface.
*   **Optimized chunk meshing:** Each chunk (whether flat or part of a sphere) builds a single optimized mesh (`surfaceMesh`) containing only the visible faces of its blocks.
*   **Texture Atlasing:** A global spritesheet (`Block::spritesheetTexture`) is used for block textures.
*   **Asynchronous chunk loading/generation:** The `World` uses multiple worker threads to handle chunk data loading, procedural generation, and mesh building, with tasks queued by `Planet` objects for their chunks.

## File Details

### `main.cpp` in `./`
This file serves as the main entry point for the AzureVoxel application. It initializes GLFW, GLEW, creates the game window, and sets up shared resources including the Block Registry system. The main loop creates a `World` object, to which `Planet` objects can be added. The main loop calls the `World`'s update and render methods, which in turn manage the planets and their chunks. A `Camera` and a 2D `Crosshair` are also managed here.

*   **`main()`** - Primary application function.
    *   Initializes GLFW and GLEW.
    *   Creates a `Window` object.
    *   Enables mouse capture for FPS camera control.
    *   **Initializes `BlockRegistry::getInstance().initialize()` before any block operations.**
    *   Initializes `Block::InitBlockShader()` and `Block::InitSpritesheet()`.
    *   Enables depth testing and face culling.
    *   Creates a `Camera` object, with adjusted starting position and speed suitable for planetary scales.
    *   Creates a `World` object (e.g., `new World("SolarSystem")`).
    *   Calls `world->addPlanet(...)` to add one or more planets with specified positions, radii, seeds, and names.
    *   Creates a `Crosshair` object.
    *   Enters the main game loop:
        *   Calculates `deltaTime` and FPS.
        *   Processes keyboard and mouse input for camera movement.
        *   Calls `world->update(camera)` to update all planets and their chunks. This includes triggering chunk generation/meshing via the world's worker thread system.
        *   Calls `world->processMainThreadTasks()` for OpenGL operations queued by worker threads.
        *   Calculates view and projection matrices (projection matrix has an increased far plane for viewing planets).
        *   Clears the screen.
        *   Calls `world->render(...)` to draw all planets.
        *   Calls `crosshair->render()` to draw the 2D crosshair.
        *   Swaps window buffers and polls events.
    *   After the loop, cleans up resources (`Block::CleanupBlockShader()`, `BlockRegistry::getInstance().shutdown()`, deletes `crosshair`, `world`, `camera`).

*   **Member Changes:**
    *   `chunks` (std::unordered_map): Removed in favor of planet-based management.
    *   `planets_` (std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Planet>>): New member to store all planets in the world.
    *   `renderDistance`, `chunkSize`: Removed as they were specific to the flat chunk grid.
    *   `worldName_` (std::string): Name for the world, used in data paths.
    *   `defaultSeed_` (int): A default seed for planets if not specified.
*   **Registry Integration:**
    *   World initialization ensures Block Registry is properly initialized before planet creation
    *   Coordinates with registry for consistent block type management across all planets
    *   Supports registry-aware block queries for cross-planet operations
*   **New Methods:**
    *   `World(worldName, defaultSeed)` (Constructor): Initializes with a world name and seed. Creates world-specific data directories. Starts the worker thread.
    *   `addPlanet(position, radius, seed, name)`: Creates a new `Planet` and adds it to the `planets_` vector.
*   **Modified Methods:**
    *   `~World()`: Manages cleanup of planets and the worker thread.
    *   `update(camera)`: Iterates through `planets_` and calls `planet->update(camera, this)`. `this` (world context) is passed so planets can queue tasks to the world's worker thread. Also calls `processMainThreadTasks()`.

*   The worker thread system (`workerThread_`, `queueMutex_`, `queueCondition_`, `taskQueue_`, `shouldTerminate_`, `workerThreadFunction`, `addMainThreadTask`, `processMainThreadTasks`) is largely preserved. It's now used for tasks queued by planets for their chunks (e.g., `Chunk::ensureInitialized`).

## Chunk Data Persistence System

### Overview
The AzureVoxel engine implements an automatic chunk data persistence system that seamlessly saves and loads chunk data to reduce generation overhead and maintain world consistency. The system operates transparently during chunk initialization, automatically handling file I/O operations based on world-specific directory structures.

### Persistence Architecture

**File Organization:**
- World-specific directories: `chunk_data/[world_name]/`
- Chunk filename pattern: `chunk_[x]_[y]_[z].chunk`
- Binary format for efficient storage and fast loading
- Automatic directory creation with proper error handling

**Save/Load Workflow:**
1. **Chunk Initialization**: `ensureInitialized()` first attempts to load existing chunk data
2. **Load Attempt**: Uses `loadFromFile_DataOnly()` to check for saved chunk files
3. **Generation Fallback**: If no file exists, generates new terrain using `generateTerrain()`
4. **Automatic Save**: Newly generated chunks are automatically saved using `saveToFile()`
5. **Mesh Building**: Both loaded and generated chunks proceed to mesh building phase

**Performance Benefits:**
- Eliminates redundant terrain generation for previously created chunks
- Reduces world loading times for established areas
- Maintains consistency across game sessions
- Supports incremental world expansion with mixed loaded/generated chunks

### Data Format
The chunk persistence system uses a compact binary format optimized for fast I/O:

**Binary Structure:**
- Sequential block type data: `[x][y][z].type` values
- Fixed size: `CHUNK_SIZE_X * CHUNK_SIZE_Y * CHUNK_SIZE_Z * sizeof(BlockInfo::type)`
- Platform-independent binary format
- Integrity validation on load with size verification

This persistence system seamlessly integrates with the Block Registry, ensuring that saved chunk data properly references registered block types and maintains compatibility across registry updates.

## Block Registry System Architecture

### Core Components

The Block Registry system implements a sophisticated component-based architecture designed for performance, modularity, and extensibility:

**1. Block Definition Layer**
- `BlockDefinition`: Immutable core block properties
- `BlockVariant`: Context-specific overrides and adaptations
- Namespace support for modular block organization
- File-based definition loading for data-driven design

**2. Context System**
- `BiomeContext`: Environmental conditions (temperature, moisture, atmospheric pressure)
- `PlanetContext`: Planetary characteristics (gravity, atmosphere, geology)
- `ContextKey`: Optimized lookup structure for context combinations
- Pre-computed context mapping tables for O(1) performance

**3. Performance Optimization Layer**
- `BlockRenderData`: Cache-friendly structure for hot-path operations
- Bit-packed flags for boolean properties

## Non-Solid Block Rendering System

### Overview
The AzureVoxel engine implements a sophisticated non-solid block rendering system that allows players to see through transparent or non-solid blocks like water, air, and leaves. This system ensures that faces of solid blocks are properly rendered when they are adjacent to non-solid blocks, creating realistic visibility through water bodies and other transparent materials.

### Block Solidity Classification
The system classifies blocks into solid and non-solid categories using the `BlockRegistry::isBlockSolid()` method, which provides O(1) lookup performance through pre-computed bit flags:

**Non-Solid Blocks:**
- Air (type 0) - Empty space
- Water (type 5) - Liquid blocks in planet cores and water bodies  
- Leaves (type 8) - Tree foliage (transparent)

**Solid Blocks:**
- Stone (type 1) - Basic rock material
- Grass (type 2) - Surface grass blocks
- Dirt (type 3) - Subsurface soil
- Sand (type 4) - Desert/beach material
- Snow (type 6) - Cold climate surface
- Wood Log (type 7) - Tree trunks
- Gravel (type 9) - Rocky debris
- Gold Ore (type 10) - Precious metal deposits

### Face Culling Logic
The mesh building system in `Chunk::buildSurfaceMesh()` implements intelligent face culling using the Block Registry's optimized `shouldRenderFace()` method:

**Rendering Rules:**
1. **Solid-to-Non-Solid Interface**: Always render the solid block's face when adjacent to non-solid blocks
2. **Solid-to-Solid Interface**: Cull faces between adjacent solid blocks (hidden from view)
3. **Chunk Boundaries**: Render faces at chunk edges for solid blocks (assumes air beyond chunk)
4. **Planetary Boundaries**: Special handling for spherical chunks where blocks outside planet radius are treated as air

**Performance Optimization:**
- Uses bit flags in `BlockRenderData` for branch-free face culling decisions
- Pre-computed neighbor checking with O(1) registry lookups
- Optimized for both flat terrain and spherical planet generation
- Supports efficient batch processing during mesh generation

### Registry Integration
The face culling system is fully integrated with the Block Registry:

```cpp
// Example usage in chunk mesh building
uint16_t currentBlockType = blockDataForInitialization_[x][y][z].type;
uint16_t neighborBlockType = blockDataForInitialization_[nx][ny][nz].type;

// O(1) registry lookup for face culling decision
bool shouldRender = registry.shouldRenderFace(currentBlockType, neighborBlockType);
```

This system ensures optimal rendering performance while maintaining visual fidelity for complex voxel environments with mixed solid and transparent materials.

### Enhanced Biome Generation System

The AzureVoxel engine now features a sophisticated multi-layer biome generation system that creates diverse and realistic terrain features:

**Biome Types:**
- **Arctic**: Extremely cold regions with ice surfaces and frozen terrain
- **Tundra**: Cold regions with snow and sparse vegetation
- **Cold**: Temperate cold areas with snow-covered surfaces
- **Forest**: Wooded areas with moss-covered stones and rich vegetation
- **Temperate**: Balanced climate zones with grass and moderate conditions
- **Tropical**: Warm, humid regions with moss stones and lush growth
- **Desert**: Hot, dry areas with sand, sandstone, and cacti
- **Swamp**: Wet, muddy regions with clay substrates and water features
- **Volcanic**: Extreme heat zones with lava, obsidian, and basalt
- **Mountain**: High-elevation rocky areas with granite formations
- **Hot**: General hot climate zones with varied terrain

**Multi-Layer Noise Generation:**
- **Temperature Noise**: Large-scale temperature variation across the planet
- **Moisture Noise**: Humidity and precipitation patterns
- **Elevation Major Noise**: Mountain ranges, valleys, and major terrain features (+/- 15 blocks)
- **Biome Transition Noise**: Smooth transitions between different biomes
- **Feature Noise**: Small-scale features like lakes, forest patches, and resource deposits
- **Lake Generation**: Dynamic lake placement in low-lying areas using elevation analysis

**Biome-Specific Materials:**
- **Surface Layer**: Biome-appropriate top materials (ice, sand, grass, lava, etc.)
- **Subsurface Layer**: Biome-influenced underground materials (clay, sandstone, basalt, etc.)
- **Deep Layer**: Geological variations with biome-specific stone types and ore deposits
- **Special Features**: Cacti in deserts, moss stones in forests, mud in swamps

**Dynamic Terrain Features:**
- **Mountains and Valleys**: Major elevation changes up to 15 blocks
- **Natural Lakes**: Generated in low-lying areas with elevation analysis
- **Biome Transitions**: Smooth gradients between different climate zones
- **Resource Distribution**: Biome-influenced ore and material placement
```
