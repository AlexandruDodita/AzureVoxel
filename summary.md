# AzureVoxel Conversation Summary (Recent Key Developments)

This summary details the implementation of a 2D crosshair, mouse capture functionality, and significant fixes to block texture rendering and face culling.

## 1. Crosshair Implementation & Mouse Capture

**Goal:** Implement a Minecraft-style fixed crosshair and mouse input for FPS camera control.

**Mouse Capture:**
*   The `Window::enableMouseCapture(bool enable)` method in `src/window.cpp` was activated (uncommented).
*   It uses `glfwSetInputMode(window, GLFW_CURSOR, GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED)` to hide the cursor and lock it to the window, allowing for continuous mouse movement for camera rotation.
*   `window.enableMouseCapture(true);` is called in `main.cpp` after window and GLEW initialization.

**2D Crosshair:**
*   **Shaders:**
    *   `shaders/crosshair_vertex.glsl`: A simple vertex shader for 2D rendering. Takes `vec2 aPos` and uses a `uniform mat4 projection` (orthographic) to set `gl_Position`.
    *   `shaders/crosshair_fragment.glsl`: A simple fragment shader that outputs a `uniform vec3 crosshairColor`.
*   **`Crosshair` Class (`headers/crosshair.h`, `src/crosshair.cpp`):**
    *   Manages its own `Shader` instance loading the crosshair shaders.
    *   Sets up a VAO and VBO for the crosshair geometry (two intersecting quads forming a '+' shape).
    *   Vertices are defined in 2D screen coordinates, centered based on screen width/height.
    *   Uses an orthographic projection matrix (`glm::ortho`) for rendering, ensuring the crosshair is drawn as a 2D overlay.
    *   `render()` method: Disables depth testing, uses its shader, binds VAO, sets uniforms (projection, color), draws the geometry, and re-enables depth testing.
    *   `updateScreenSize()`: Allows recalculation of projection if window size changes.
*   **Integration:**
    *   `CMakeLists.txt`: Updated to copy `crosshair_vertex.glsl` and `crosshair_fragment.glsl` to the build's `shaders` directory. `crosshair.cpp` and `crosshair.h` added to sources and headers. `pthread` linking was also ensured.
    *   `main.cpp`:
        *   Includes `headers/crosshair.h`.
        *   A `Crosshair* crosshair` pointer is declared globally.
        *   Initialized with `new Crosshair(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT)` after window setup.
        *   `crosshair->render()` is called in the main game loop after rendering the 3D world and before swapping buffers.
        *   Cleaned up with `delete crosshair;` at the end of `main`.

## 2. Texture Rendering and Face Culling Fixes

**Initial Problem:** Block textures were smeared, and many block faces were not rendering, appearing transparent or invisible.

**Diagnostics & Fixes:**

*   **UV Coordinate Size Correction:**
    *   The assumption for sub-texture size in `Spritesheet.PNG` was corrected from 16x16 to 80x80 pixels.
    *   In `Chunk::buildSurfaceMesh` (`src/chunk.cpp`):
        *   `uvPixelOffsetX` and `uvPixelOffsetY` values for different `blockType`s were updated to be multiples of 80.
        *   The UV calculation `(uvPixelOffsetX + texCoords[i].x * 16.0f)` was changed to `(uvPixelOffsetX + texCoords[i].x * 80.0f)`.

*   **Face Culling and Winding Order:**
    *   **Observation:** Only some faces were rendering (e.g., one lateral side when above, bottom faces when below). Disabling `glCullFace` made all faces appear, but with "inside-out" issues for some.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Incorrect or inconsistent vertex winding order was causing `glCullFace(GL_BACK)` to cull faces that should be visible.
    *   **Attempt 1 (Universal Index Reversal):** Reversing the triangle indices in `Chunk::buildSurfaceMesh` (e.g., from `0,1,2` to `0,2,1`) showed *more* faces but still not all, indicating the winding issue was not uniformly "backwards."
    *   **Solution (Corrected `faceVertices`):**
        *   The primary fix was to redefine the `const glm::vec3 faceVertices[][4]` array in `src/chunk.cpp`.
        *   The original vertex order for some faces resulted in Clockwise (CW) winding when viewed from outside the cube.
        *   The `faceVertices` array was replaced with a standard set of vertex coordinates for a cube that ensures all faces have a Counter-Clockwise (CCW) winding order when viewed from the outside.
        *   The triangle indexing in `Chunk::buildSurfaceMesh` was reverted to the standard `0,1,2` and `2,3,0` (relative to the face's starting vertex index).
        *   With `glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);` and `glCullFace(GL_BACK);` active in `main.cpp`, this corrected vertex definition now results in all external block faces rendering correctly.

**Alpha Discard:**
*   A temporary diagnostic involved commenting out `if(texColor.a < 0.1) discard;` in the block fragment shader (`src/block.cpp`). This helped confirm that faces weren't just transparent but were actually being culled. This line was later restored.

**Outcome:** Block textures are now mapped correctly using 80x80 sub-textures from the atlas, and all six faces of a block render appropriately due to correct vertex winding order and back-face culling.
